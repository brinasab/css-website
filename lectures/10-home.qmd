## Learning Objectives

- Understand what Base R is, and how it differs from the Tidyverse
- Identify R data types and structures  
- Explore R vectors 
- Subset data using Base R syntax


## Readings

* [Chapter 20 “Vectors”](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/vectors.html) in "R for Data Science" 1st Edition. I assigned the 1st Edition because I find it a bit clearer on this topic than the 2nd Edition, but you might want to take a look also at [Chapter 12 "Logical Vectors"](https://r4ds.hadley.nz/logicals) and [Chapter 13 "Numbers"](https://r4ds.hadley.nz/numbers) of the 2nd Edition and decide what you prefer. Either works!
* [Chapter 27 "A field guide to base R"](https://r4ds.hadley.nz/base-r) in "R for Data Science" 2nd Edition.
