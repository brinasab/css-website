### Sotfware Setup Fall 2025

<div class="my-4"></div>

This section of the website guides you through everything you need to set up for the course:

**1. First, Configure your Setup: [RStudio Workbench Setup](setup-workbench.qmd)**

**2. Second, Test your Setup: [Git within RStudio Tutorial](setup-test.qmd)**

**3. Third, Learn More: [What are these Tools?](what.qmd)**

::: {.callout-note}

These instructions are for **RStudio Workbench**, which is the platform we use in this course. If you have prior programming experience and prefer to install R and RStudio on your own computer, reach out to discuss.

<!--

### First, Configure your Setup

Go to the [RStudio Workbench Setup](setup-workbench.qmd) page and follow the instructions there. This includes three steps:

- Create a (free) GitHub account  
- Log into RStudio Workbench  
- Configure Git inside RStudio Workbench  

Take your time with each step, especially the third one. Everything you set up here will make your workflow smoother later in the course.

### Then, Test Your Setup

Once you've everything configured, test that it's working as expected by completing the [Git within RStudio Tutorial](setup-test.qmd). This will confirm that Git is properly connected and you are ready to go.

These instructions are specifically for using **RStudio Workbench**, which is the platform we'll be using throughout the course. If you have prior programming experience and prefer to install R and RStudio on your own computer, feel free to reach out to discuss.
